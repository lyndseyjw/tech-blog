## An MVC-Structured Blog Site for Developers to Share Technical Concepts, Recent Advancements &amp; New Technologies 

## Overview

This application was a wonderful challenge of my MVC knowledge. It really tested my ability to understand the logic & flow of a full stack web application. I realized my greatest strength is within frontend javascript. I absolutely love dynamically manipulating the DOM but found that this can cause quite a bit of confusion when the answer might simply be to render a new handlebars page. I had to swallow my pride & resist making complex frontend javascript files in order to make a concise MVC structure that would be user friendly & functional.

I had a lot of fun working on this despite many of the struggles as the end result was well worth all the effort. I appreciate the many (many, many) failures because they helped strengthen my de-bugging skills & eye for detail. Something as simple as misnaming a route can throw off the entire application & helped me implement strict 'singular noun' rules that I will carry throughout my career. 

This application supplies the user with every route (GET, DELETE, etc.), making this a fully dynamic, interactive UI & DB. The folders are also concise & organized in a way that any developer could easily come in & edit / update as necessary & without difficulty.
